## PGN H5

Just a little thought experiment of mine...I could envision this turning in to something cool, (web-based, networked chess server comes to mind), but for now it's just the bare-bones of a PGN reader done in Javascript and HTML 5.


### TODO

- Need to figure out how to eliminate from "possible moves" any move that would require the piece to move 'through' another piece
